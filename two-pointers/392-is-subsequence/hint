1. Logic is simple: one pointer for the substring (move only after found it in the string), one pointer for the string
(move it to check each char).
2. Because our main loop is through the string and we increase this index unconditionally (unlike substring index),
we can use range to avoid manually controlling it
3. Amount of matched chars are the same as chars in the substring (s) -> return true. The string is finished, but we
still didn't pass the whole substring -> return false
4. Don't forget about corner case, when substring is empty! In this case it is a valid substring for any string
