1. Classical sliding window problem - easy indeed.
2. To easily update window sum in a loop we have compute the initial value (from i to j exclusive) BEFORE the loop
3. In the loop we just add j-index val, count avg and exclude i-index val
4. DON'T FORGET TO SET THE INITIAL VAL OF MAX SUM TO -INF (NOT TO 0!) TO UPDATE MAXIMUM NEGATIVE SUM CORRECTLY
