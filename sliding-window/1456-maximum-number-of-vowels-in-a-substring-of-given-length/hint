1. Same sliding window pattern: make a window (one char shorter than k), count vowels. Then add last window char ->
check if it's a vowel -> check if it's max vowels -> remove first char from the window -> if it's a vowel, decrease the
vowels count
2. Repeat till the window's border reaches the end of the given string
3. PROFIT
