1. Just traverse the linked list and change "next" link to the previous node, but there are some aspects to remember:
a. it's better to handle corner cases first: empty linkedlist and 1 element linkedlist
b. don't forget to set None as new "next" of a head of the linkedlist
c. VERY IMPORTANT: while traversing, we need to save an ORIGINAL "NEXT" link of each node before reversing it
d. after changing "next" link to the previous node, we use ORIGINAL "NEXT" to traverse the linkedlist
e. DO NOT FORGET: at the end we're returning NOT the OLD head (it's now the last node), but the NEW head (the var, which
we used to traverse the linked list - for instance, "current_node")
