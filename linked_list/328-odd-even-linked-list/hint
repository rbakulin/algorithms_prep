1. The first thing: you need to group odd INDEXES after the even ones, NOT the odd VALUES
2. The only way to connect the LAST EVEN index to the FIRST ODD is to store THE FIRST ODD node at the separate var AT
THE BEGINNING
3. We can handle the cases when there are no nodes at all (return None) and only 1 or 2 nodes (no need to group anything)
from the beginning
4. The further algorithm is simple: go through every 3 nodes and change next value till you traverse all the nodes
