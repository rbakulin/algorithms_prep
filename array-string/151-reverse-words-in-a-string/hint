1. At first sight, we need only 1 index, but remember, that we need to get rid of both leading and trailing spaces -
that's why we're going to need 2 indexes
2. Pay special attention that we're adding chars to a new array: we're adding every of them, including the starting char
3. I prefer going from the ending to the begging of they original string - it seems more intuitive for reversing
4. But it's important to remember, that the words must not be added in reverse order, e.g.
we're reversing each word once again before adding to the array
