1. This problem is all about corner cases
2. Think of what if n == 0
3. You don't have to check anything if n is too big for given flowerbed
4. What if flowerbed consists only of 1 or 2 elements (the behaviour is the same)
5. You need to check element's nearest neighbors but remember of first and last element
6. Remember that if you change n in the last iteration you need to if n is 0 separately
