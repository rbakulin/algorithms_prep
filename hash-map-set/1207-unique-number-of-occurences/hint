1. Fairly easy task, however there's room for mistakes:
A. In a DICT of popularity remember to use get() func to avoid KEY ERROR when you add a value for the first time
B. To check if all values in the dict are UNIQUE, we can just compare LENGTHS of dict.keys() and dict.keys() CONVERTED
TO A SET (NO EXTRA CONVERSIONS needed, NEITHER comparing each key)
