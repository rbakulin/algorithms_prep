1. This task is just a trick: those strangely described conditions look like that for a reason
2. You don't need to do manually those 2 operations to check, if conditions are satisfied
3. Basically, we need to check 2 things:
a. Both words consist of the same set of chars
b. Values of frequency are the same (doesn't matter, that they could be for different chars inside of our set)
4. Using 2 dicts -> comparing sets of the keys -> comparing sorted lists of values
5. DON'T FORGET to use sorted(), NOT sort() (it returns None)
