1. There's no better solution than bruteforce, but we can optimize comparing lines (from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using dict
for keeping lines instead of list
2. When we use dict, we need to convert line lists to immutable type - tuple
3. Also, it's very important to count multiple identical rows correctly:
A. instead of keeping each formed vertical line in a dict, we check EACH of it in the horizontal dict
B. when we count intersections, we're adding all horizontal line to our counter (+= dict[tuple(formed_column)], NOT +=1)
