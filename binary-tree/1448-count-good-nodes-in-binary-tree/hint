1. ATTENTION! The root node si also considered as good node
2. The algorithm is pretty much the same usual DFS (Depth First Search): go to the left in each subtree till the leaf ->
go 1 lvl up -> try to go to the right subtree
3. But we need to count the good nodes - the easiest way is to put all them in the array and return its length in the end
4. So to pass the string array from one call to another we need to mace a separate function, that takes 3 arguments:
node to check, the maximum val on the path to the node to check and the array to store all the good nodes
