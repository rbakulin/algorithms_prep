1. This problem looks more difficult than it is
2. We use stack for keeping asteroids
3. We're going through EVERY asteroid and we check if we must start simulating collision for every element
4. The conditions for starting simulating collision are simple:
a. current asteroid is negative (moving left)
b. there's something to collide with (the stack is not empty)
c. asteroid, that collides (last in the stack) with the current asteroid is positive (moving right)
5. Using break for NOT saving current asteroid in the stack
6. If the current asteroid doesn't fall for simulating conditions -> we're simply saving it in the stack
