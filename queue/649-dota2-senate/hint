1. To solve this problem, we have to define the structures and simulate their interaction:
a. structure for storing members of the senate: their team and their order (the order affects who acts after who)
b. simulate they trying to block the closest member of the opposite team
c. simulate the rounds (when every member, who isn't block, had his turn - the round ends, after that a new round starts)
d. condition for stopping the game and declaring a winner
2. Solution:
a. using 2 queues to store indexes of members of each team
b. poping first elements of both and compare: which index is smaller - wins (blocks the member of the opposite team)
c. the winner is appended back to his queue, but with + n to his orginal index
(so he moves AFTER anyone, who didn't have a turn yet)
d. when one of the queues is empty - it's time to stop and declare the opposite team a winner
3. Why 2 queues? With 1 queue we would need:
a. to store BOTH member's team AND index: [(team, i)]
b. a structure to keep track is current member is blocked: banned = {'R': 0, 'D': 0}
c. a structure for checking if both teams are still in the game: remaining = {'R': senate.count('R'), 'D': senate.count('D')}
The 1 queue solution would look like this:
    while remaining['R'] > 0 and remaining['D'] > 0:
        party, idx = queue.pop(0)
        opponent = 'D' if party == 'R' else 'R'
        if banned[party] > 0:
            banned[party] -= 1
            remaining[party] -= 1
        else:
            banned[opponent] += 1
            queue.append((party, idx + n))
    return "Radiant" if remaining['R'] > 0 else "Dire"
Which is much more difficult to read and error prone
