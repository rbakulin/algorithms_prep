1. This problem just articulate poorly - in reality we need to just write a function, that:
a. takes an int (request time in milliseconds)
b. this int is considered a request
c. we need to add this request to the array of requests, the array stored in the instance (initialized in a constructor)
d. then just return the COUNT of the requests which time in the interval: last request's time - 3000
